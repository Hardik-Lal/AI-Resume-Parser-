# AI Resume Parser

This project automates the process of parsing resumes using AWS services. The system is designed for HR professionals and recruiters to easily upload resumes, extract key information (such as name, email, phone number, skills, and experience), and store the parsed data. The backend is powered by AWS services, including S3 for storage, Lambda for serverless processing, and IAM for secure access management.

## Features:
- Upload resumes (PDF) to AWS S3
- Automatically parse resumes with AWS Lambda
- Extract key information from resumes, such as name, email, phone, and skills
- Secure cloud infrastructure using IAM roles and policies

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** for developing the parsing logic
- **AWS EC2** for server hosting
- **AWS S3** for storing uploaded resumes
- **AWS Lambda** for automated processing of resumes
- **AWS IAM** for secure access control
